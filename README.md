# My Project

This project is a **Serverless Progressive Web Application (PWA)** built with **React** and developed using a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** technique.

## Key Features

- **Serverless:** This means the application can scale automatically and you only pay for what you use.
- **Progressive Web Application (PWA):** This type of application can work offline, can be installed on a user's device, and progressively improves with the user's device capabilities/network connection.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single page applications.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** A development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

## Integration

The application integrates with the **Google Calendar API** to fetch upcoming events.
